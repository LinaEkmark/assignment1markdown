Fenced Code Blocks
==================

Summary
-------

This extension adds a secondary way to define code blocks which overcomes a few
limitations of the indented code blocks.

This extension is included in the standard Markdown library.

Syntax
------

Fenced Code Blocks are defined using either the syntax established in 
[PHP Markdown Extra][php] or in [Github Flavored Markdown][gfm].

[php]: http://www.michelf.com/projects/php-markdown/extra/#fenced-code-blocks
[gfm]: http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/

    This is a paragraph introducing:

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    a one-line code block
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    And here's another:

    ```
    one-line code block
    ```

Fenced code blocks can have a blank line as the first and/or last line
of a code block and they can also come immediately after a list item
without becoming part of the list.

You can define the language of the code block for use by syntax
highlighters etc. The language will be assigned as a class attribute
of the ``<pre>`` element in the output. Therefore, you should define
the language as you would a css class - ``.language``. For consistency
with other markdown syntax, the language can *optionally* be wrapped
in curly brackets:

    ~~~~{.python}
    # python code
    ~~~~

    ~~~~.html
    <p>HTML Document</p>
    ~~~~

The above will output:

    <pre class="python"># python code
    </pre>
    
    <pre class="html">&lt;p&gt;HTML Document&lt;/p&gt;
    </pre>

You can also cause the lines of the code block to be numbered
automatically by specifying a numbering mode, which must be preceeded
by a semicolon:

    ```{.python;lines}
    # numbered lines of python
    ```

    ```;statements
    # numbered statements
    ```

The modes are *lines*, *statements*, *skipblanks*, and *stmtskip*. In
lines mode, every line is numbered. In statements mode, statements are
numbered (so lines preceeded by a line ending with a comma or
backslash are *not* numbered). With skipblanks, blank lines are not
numbered, and stmtskip is the combination of statements and
skipblanks.

If a mode is given, an offset may also be given, after the mode. This
is an integer, preceeded by a semicolon.

    ```{.python;lines;37}
    # python code, numbered starting with line 37
    ```


Usage
-----

From the Python interpreter:

    >>> html = markdown.markdown(text, ['fenced_code'])

From the command line:

    markdown_py -x fenced_code [SOURCE]
