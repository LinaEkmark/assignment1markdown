Available Extensions
====================

Python Markdown offers a flexible extension mechanism, which makes it possible
to change and/or extend the behavior of the parser without having to edit the
actual source files.

To use an extension, pass it to markdown with the `extensions` keyword.

    markdown.markdown(some_text, extensions=[MyExtension(), 'path.to.my.ext', 'markdown.extensions.footnotes'])

See the [Library Reference](../reference.md#extensions) for more details.

From the command line, specify an extension with the `-x` option. 

    $ python -m markdown -x markdown.extensions.footnotes -x markdown.extensions.tables input.txt > output.html

See the [Command Line docs](../cli.md) or use the `--help` option for more details.

    If you would like to write your own extensions, see the
    [Extension API](api.md) for details.
